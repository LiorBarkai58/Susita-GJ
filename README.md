# Susita-GJ

This repository contains the project that was made for Tiltan's internal GameJam with the Theme: Susita
The game was later presented at the Haifa museum under the Susita exhibition.
Combined subway-surfer like gameplay with small questions lead you to scan a QR code in the museum and advance to the next level.
